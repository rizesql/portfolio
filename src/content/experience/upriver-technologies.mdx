# Healthentia

**I held the position of intern, working in the course of a year and a half on several projects.**

The first one was Healthentia, a mobile application developed in React Native, where I contributed to the Android version, where I solved a bunch of problems, ranging from low-level bugs to UX design.

The biggest impact I had was solving a range of problems that made the app crash on startup, thus making it unusable. With those bugs gone, I enabled my colleagues to work on the app and be able to implement useful functionalities.

# Momsi

The next project I participated in was Momsi, where I developed and maintained both the mobile app and the backend server for the social platform. The biggest contributions I have made were the improvement of the onboarding section, solving numerous major errors in the Marketplace section, and last but not least I developed many functionalities from scratch.

For some time, I was the only full-time developer on the project, and I managed to deliver valuable improvements and features even if I am just a junior.

# Dinner in the Sky

Lastly, I developed an online reservation system for the brand Dinner in the Sky Romania, which includes a web application, intended for the creation of reservations by the customers, and an admin panel, intended for the management team. The latter was created for the ease of reservation handling and for editing the web app content in real-time.

I am specifically proud about this one, because as a junior, I managed to develop on my own the whole client side of the applications from zero.

## Departing

Sadly, I was obliged by the circumstances to put a hold on my collaboration with the team at Upriver, because I was in a period in my life where I had to focus a lot more on my studies. Even so, I managed to be admitted to the college I wanted and I still have a good relation with my mentor from Upriver Technologies, Andrei, to whom I am thankful for kickstarting my career and trusting me.
